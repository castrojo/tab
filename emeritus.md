# TAB Emeritus

This document honors individuals who have served the CNCF End User community and Technical Advisory Board in leadership positions.

## About This Record

The CNCF End User community began in January 2019 as an informal, staff-coordinated group to connect cloud native technology end users. In June 2025, it was formalized as the **Technical Advisory Board (TAB)** with defined roles, governance, and elected/appointed positions.

This record recognizes contributions across both eras:
- **Pre-TAB Era (2019-2025)**: CNCF staff and coordinators who managed the community
- **TAB Era (June 2025-present)**: Elected and appointed members serving in formal positions
